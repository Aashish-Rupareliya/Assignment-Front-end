In React, components can be created as either class components or functional components. Each type has its own way of managing the component lifecycle. Here's an explanation of both:

Class Component Lifecycle
Class components in React have a series of lifecycle methods that can be overridden to execute code at specific points in a component's life:

Mounting: When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

constructor(): Called before the component is mounted. It's used to initialize state and bind methods.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Called right before rendering, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state or null to update nothing.
render(): The only required method in a class component. It returns the JSX to be rendered.
componentDidMount(): Invoked immediately after the component is mounted. It's a good place to initiate API calls and set up subscriptions.
Updating: When the component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.

static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Same as in the mounting phase.
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): Determines whether the component should re-render or not. By default, it returns true. It can be used for performance optimization.
render(): Same as in the mounting phase.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Called right before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM. It can return a value which will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate.
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): Called immediately after updating occurs. Not called for the initial render.
Unmounting: When a component is being removed from the DOM.

componentWillUnmount(): Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Used for cleanup (e.g., invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up subscriptions).
Error Handling: When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError(error): Called when an error is thrown in a descendant component. Used to update the state to display an error boundary.
componentDidCatch(error, info): Called when an error is thrown in a descendant component. Used to log error information.
Functional Component with Hooks
Functional components use Hooks to manage lifecycle events and state. The most commonly used hooks for lifecycle management are useEffect and useState.

Mounting: When the component is being inserted into the DOM.

useEffect(() => { ... }, []): This hook runs after the component is mounted. The empty dependency array [] ensures it runs only once.
Updating: When the component re-renders due to changes in props or state.

useEffect(() => { ... }, [dependencies]): This hook runs after every render if any value in the dependencies array changes. If you want to perform side effects on every update, omit the dependency array.
Unmounting: When the component is being removed from the DOM.

useEffect(() => { return () => { ... }; }, []): The function returned by useEffect is the cleanup function, which runs when the component unmounts. The empty dependency array [] ensures this cleanup runs only once when the component unmounts.
Error Handling: Unlike class components, functional components don't have built-in error boundaries. You need to create an error boundary class component to wrap around your functional component if error handling is required.
